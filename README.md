> *Important: This release is a **developer preview** and is free and open-source from Confluent under the Apache 2.0 license. Do not run KSQL against a production cluster.*

KSQL is an open source streaming SQL engine for Apache Kafka. It provides a simple and completely interactive SQL interface for stream processing on Kafka; no need to write code in a programming language such as Java or Python. KSQL is open-source (Apache 2.0 licensed), distributed, scalable, reliable, and real-time. It supports a wide range of powerful stream processing operations including aggregations, joins, windowing, sessionization, and much more.
