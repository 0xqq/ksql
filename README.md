# KSQL - Streaming SQL for Apache Kafka

> *Important: This release is a **developer preview** and is free and open-source from Confluent under the Apache 2.0 license. Do not run KSQL against a production cluster.*

KSQL is an open source streaming SQL engine that implements continuous, interactive queries against Apache Kafka™.
It allows you to read, write, and process streaming data in real-time, at scale, using SQL-like semantics.

KSQL does not require proficiency with a programming language such as Java or Python, and it does not require you to install and manage a separate processing cluster technology. As such, it opens up the world of stream processing to a broader set of users and applications than ever before.

KSQL is tightly integrated with Apache Kafka and its processing guarantees.  This includes Apache Kafka’s strongest guarantee, exactly-once processing.  This means KSQL provides you with worry-free stream processing without any data loss or duplication so that you can easily build reliable real-time applications.
