# ![KSQL rocket](ksq-lrocket.png) KSQL - Streaming SQL for Apache Kafka

> *Important: This release is a **developer preview** and is free and open-source from Confluent under the Apache 2.0 license. Do not run KSQL against a production cluster.*

KSQL lowers the entry bar to the world of stream processing by providing you with a simple and completely interactive SQL interface with which you can process your data in Kafka most easily.  No longer do you need to write code in a programming language such as Java or Python! KSQL is open-source (Apache 2.0 licensed), distributed, scalable, reliable, and real-time.  It supports a wide range of powerful stream processing operations including aggregations, joins, windowing, sessionization, and much more.
